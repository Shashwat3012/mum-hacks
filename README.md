This is the Mumbai Hacks 2025 project repository.

## Problem Statement
Create an Agentic AI system that continuously scans multiple sources of information, detects emerging misinformation, verifies facts, and provides easy-to-understand, contextual updates to the public during crises.

## Solution
In times of crisis false information travels quickly than it can be verified, creating confusion, panic, and even loss of life.

Miss. Information is an agentic multimodal AI system that identifies, authenticates, and clarifies misinformation in real-time on messaging apps like Whatsapp & Telegram using custom bots and by querying websites using our Browser Extension.

The platform also includes deepfake and media forgery detection (faces, voices, frames), reverse image search, and audio analysis to identify manipulated content.

A Crisis Dashboard graphically depicts rumor dissemination with real-time heatmaps, alert levels, and geographical insights.

Gamified Truth Swipe : Users swipe left for Fake & right for Real News based on viral news snippets, memes or images. The game is available live on Snapchat.

Multiple specialized AI agents work autonomously to power the system:
1. Collector Agent persistently collects data from WhatsApp & Telegram forwards through user uploads & websites through chrome extension.
2. Claim Detection Agent extracts multimodal factual "claims" from text, images, videos, and memes using NLP and vision models.
3. Fact Verification Agent compares these claims with government portals, reliable fact-check databases (generated by our Web Scraper), and fact-checked news APIs like GoogleNews & GoogleFactCheck.
4. Distribution Agent conveys validated results instantly through the WhatsApp & Telegram bots integration, and Browser extension.
